<p>A project for a Data Structures class at NSCC. This project is Shows various sorting algorithms in their times to sort 100000 randomly generated ints. It shows the drastic difference between the slow ones (bubble, selection, insertion) and the fast ones (shell, merge, quick). There is also an external merge sort, used to simulate what would happen if memory on the computer was extremely limited, and if external storage had to be used. The external merge sort also had to be stable.</p><br/>
